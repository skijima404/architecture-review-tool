## Purpose

This document is intended for use by generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT-based review assistants) to:

- Extract review purposes from user context
- Infer relevant risks and associated review axes
- Drive structured review flows based on scenario-specific triggers

## Usage in AI-Supported Tools

- As a visual knowledge map for grounding prompts
- As an internal logic source for review scenario selection
